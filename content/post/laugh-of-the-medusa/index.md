>Come, you spirits  
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,  
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full  
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;  
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,  
That no compunctious visitings of nature  
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between  
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,  
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,  
Wherever in your sightless substances  
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,  
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,  
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,  
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,  
To cry 'Hold, hold!'

— *Macbeth*, Act I, Scene V

The year is 1968. Left-wing unrest simmers. In May, it explodes into anger,
protest, and the threat of revolution. A quarter of France takes to the streets
in protest against capitalism, rampant consumerism, the threat of American
imperialism, and the repression of tradition. Students tear up the pavement
stones to build barricades. Liberating chants echo through deserted streets:
*Il est interdit de interdire,* or *Soyez realistes, demandez l'impossible,* or
*Élections, piège à con*[^1]. In the heat of the moment few would care that
their fire would peter out and their hopes would be turned to disillusion and
nostalgia for a lost future. The political possibilities of May 1968 did not
outlive the year, but in the foment of desires to create the new, Hélène Cixous
would see a vision of new territories in feminist literature. Seven years
later, in an essay titled *Le Rire de la Méduse*, she would urge women to
"Write! Writing is for you, you are for you; your body is yours, take it." 

*The Laugh of the Medusa* is a beautiful text, but I find my words unequal to
the text that I am meant to "advertise" (what a dull damp word that reeks of
the financier). I begin with a long passage from the text. If the passage
piques your interest, read on or go and read the essay. If it does not, well,
*tant pis*.

We begin:

>I wished that that woman would write and proclaim this unique empire so that
>other women, other unacknowledged sovereigns, might exclaim: I, too, overflow;
>my desires have invented new desires, my body knows unheard-of songs. Time and
>again I, too, have felt so full of luminous torrents that I could burst—burst
>with forms much more beautiful than those which are put up in frames and sold
>for a stinking fortune. And I, too, said nothing, showed nothing; I didn't
>open my mouth, I didn't repaint my half of the world. I was ashamed. I was
>afraid, and I swallowed my shame and my fear. I said to myself: You are mad!
>What's the meaning of these waves, these floods, these outbursts? Where is the
>ebullient, infinite woman who, immersed as she was in her naiveté, kept in the
>dark about herself, led into self-disdain by the great arm of
>parental-conjugal phallocentrism, hasn't been ashamed of her strength? Who,
>surprised and horrified by the fantastic tumult of her drives (for she was
>made to believe that a well-adjusted normal woman has a... divine composure),
>hasn't accused herself of being a monster? Who, feeling a funny desire
>stirring inside her (to sing, to write, to dare to speak, in short, to bring
>out something new), hasn't thought she was sick? Well, her shameful sickness
>is that she resists death, that she makes trouble.

*The Laugh of the Medusa* is a text that exhorts women to write as *women*, as
the *other*, as the seductive and sexually charged; it is an exhortation to
renounce the rules of writing set down by men who abandon the body to write
through the mind alone as if reason without feeling could compass existence.
Women must write outside categories. Women must write with white ink to carve
out new territories from the ineffable spaces that lie beyond the rational.

>Woman un-thinks the unifying, regulating history that homogenizes and channels
>forces, herding contradictions into a single battlefield.

The witches return from their caves in the dark woods that terrified old men
and little boys and bring with them a new song that replenishes and revitalizes
our exhausted literature.

*The Laugh of the Medusa* is a feminist *text*, an écriture, a sort of nexus of
everything *around* writing that cannot be subsumed by the text and which
corresponds to no empirical reality. Cixous borrows from the post-structuralist
tradition the doubts that language can adequately reality. The Word, the atom
of textual meaning, only signifies through differences. What we call a "tree"
is a tree not through some Platonic ideal of a tree that we carry in our minds
since birth, but by reference to everything else that is *not* a tree. This
leaves a gap between *sign* and *signifier* that cannot be bridged. Language is
a mere replacement of *this* for *that*. We tend to believe, carrying on our
backs the weight of tradition since Plato, that the replacement is total, or
that, at least, with enough qualifiers and sufficient hypotactic complexity, it
can become total. This is a dream.[^2] To the extent that Truth exists, it
cannot be captured completely in language. Language does not support a
metaphysics. We renounce Truth, but we gain Poetry in the interstitial spaces
between the word and the thing itself. These gaps—shadows, mirrors, enigmas,
figurations—are counter-images to the Word, to Truth, and, for Cixous, to the
Male. To investigate and emphasize these gaps is a transgressive act and a
revolt against both logo– and phallo–centrism. 

Hélène Cixous was born in Oran, Algeria, to a multicultural Jewish family. Her
father died while she was young; her mother became a midwife and young Hélène
would often accompany her during the day. In the turmoil of the Algerian Civil
War, Cixous emigrates to Paris. At university she meets Jacques Derrida and
is introduced to the writings of Clarice Lispector, both strong influences
on her later philosophy and thought. She obtains a chair in English literature
at the University of Nanterre while she finishes work on a doctoral
dissertation on James Joyce.

So then, a Jewish woman from a former colony whose politics are revolutionary
and whose philosophy targets the core of Western thought writes an essay of
feminist literary theory with the title *The Laugh of the Medusa*. But why
should the Medusa laugh? Medusa is the original *femme fatale* (or *femme
tragique*) of mythology, the woman whose locks of hair are hissing snakes, and
whose gaze can turn to stone any man that dares look on her. There is nothing
in the myth to make us laugh. Medusa is born beautiful:

>Beyond all others she  
was famed for beauty, and the envious hope  
of many suitors. Words would fail to tell  
the glory of her hair, most wonderful  
of all her charms.

— Ovid, *Metamorphoses, Book IV*

Her beauty inflames the desire of Poseidon, god of the sea. Mortals cannot
fight against gods, and so she is raped in Athena's temple. Bright-eyed Athena,
patron and protectress of heroes, goddess who won Athens in a contest against
Poseidon, shies her eyes from the crime and punishes the victim.

>Poseidon raped her
>in chaste Athena's temple. While enraged  
>she turned her head away and held her shield  
>before her eyes. To punish that great crime  
>Athena changed the Gorgon's splendid hair  
>to serpents horrible. And now to strike  
>her foes with fear, she wears upon her breast  
>those awful vipers—creatures of her rage.

Shunned and tormented, Medusa flees Greece and wanders throughout Northern
Africa. She settles in a remote rocky place hidden deep within a dark wood far
beyond the tallest mountains of Africa. She is so terrible to look at that all
who face her gaze are turned to stone. She awaits death. Her wish is eventually
granted:

>“Along the way, in fields and by the roads,  
>I saw on all sides men and animals—  
>like statues—turned to flinty stone at sight  
>of dread Medusa's visage. Nevertheless  
>reflected on the brazen shield, I bore  
>upon my left, I saw her horrid face.  
>
>“When she was helpless in the power of sleep  
>and even her serpent-hair was slumber-bound,  
>I struck, and took her head sheer from the neck.—  
>To winged Pegasus the blood gave birth,  
>his brother also, twins of rapid wing.”

A woman is raped by a god while the goddess that is meant to protect her turns
her glowing locks of hair to horrible snakes. She wanders the earth in search
of a place where she can be left in peace to die a solitary death, but men
cannot resist the temptation to see the disgraced woman. It is meaningful that
a tale older than writing makes a monster of a woman whose only wish is to live
outside the society of men. Men look at her and are turned to stone because she
is that which they cannot control: the purely feminine that reflects the
petrifying oppression of the patriarchy onto the beholder. Out of the blood of
her corpse springs the animal that will give man wings. It is only by killing
that which we cannot understand that we can lay claim to spaces where our
imagination wants to soar.  

This is the myth that Cixous interrogates. The Medusa of myth, the monster with
serpent hair whose gaze turns others to stone, is a tragic figure because her
laugh and joy, survival and perseverance have been written out to protect the
male ego from anything that would challenge its rule. To look Medusa in the eye
is to subject yourself to the feminine. This is too much for most. The gaze of
the Medusa can only be seen in a mirror, through a glass darkly. For Cixous,
the feminine is a mode of thinking, a mode of writing that proclaims the *body*
supreme over the mind, and whose harmonies are those of the first song, the
motherly lullaby. The feminine is the self-assurance to look the dread Medusa
in the eye and to become not paralyzed but energized.

>In women's speech, as in their writing, that element which never stops
>resonating, which, once we've been permeated by it, profoundly and
>imperceptibly touched by it, retains the power of moving us—that element is
>the song: first music from the first voice of love which is alive in every
>woman. Why this privileged relationship with the voice? Because no woman
>stockpiles as many defenses for countering the drives as does a man. You don't
>build walls around yourself, you don't forego pleasure as "wisely" as he.
>[...] There is always within her at least a little of that good mother's milk.
>She writes in white ink.

Writing becomes a form of revolutionary praxis. It opens a path for
self-expression that logocentrism had kept shut. It leads into the deep dark
woods where the Medusa reigns supreme.

>To write. An act which will not only "realize" the decensored relation of
>woman to her sexuality, to her womanly being, giving her access to her native
>strength; it will give her back her goods, her pleasures, her organs, her
>immense bodily territories which have been kept under seal.

In the gaze of the Medusa we come to see ourselves newborn.

>You only have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her. And she's not
>deadly. She's beautiful and she's laughing.

been blind for forty odd years undergoes surgery and suddenly regains his
sight. His wife takes him to the park where he asks, pointing at a statue of a
lion, "What is that?". The wife tells him it's a lion. Incredulous, he goes up
to the statue, touches it for minutes, and exclaims "It *is* a lion!".
